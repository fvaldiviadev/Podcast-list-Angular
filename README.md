# Podcasts list with Angular

**Web App** developed in **Angular 6** that shows a list of top 100 podcasts from iTunes. 
I use **HttpClient** for calls to iTunes API.

## How to run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
